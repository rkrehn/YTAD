# YouTube Album Downloader (YTAD)

The software seamlessly downloads full albums from any YouTube Music playlist in the highest available MP3 format.

Simply copy and paste the playlist link from YouTube Music into YTAD. With one click, it finds the best audio sources from the related YouTube video and stitches together the full album. YTAD grabs the highest bitrate audio available for premium sound quality. It's perfect for use with [Plex Music](https://www.plex.tv/plexamp/).
